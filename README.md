# vinylproject

This was my group project, for the course "mobile application development," at Bicocca University.
We did not explore Pattern BLoc in depth (so it is not in the code) , but we took advantage of all the latest Flutter 2020/2021 features.
The 'application was evaluated with a grade of 29/30.
